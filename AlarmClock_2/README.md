# Alarm Clock 2

## What
- Simple implementation of an alarm clock with multiple threads if needed.
- The system constantly creates new alarms with name and time unless you enter "q" for quit.
- Take system input as count down time, print alert message when the time is up.

## Run instruction
Import necessary lib, compile the java file under app package, run the `main()` inside `Clock.java`.

## Design
Mainly use `java.util.Timer` in this implementation.
